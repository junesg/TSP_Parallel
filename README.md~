# Traveling Salesman Problem MPI Implementation

## Method I have coded and developed:


### MST (create initial solution from a file)
#### Usage: MST.cpp, graph.cpp, doublylinked.cpp, and DisjointSets.cpp
	*	calling files
	*	call DLlFromMST(string file name)
	*	the MST method reads from the file, performs minimum spanning tree, and uses a depth first search to reach a final solution
	
	
### GA 


#### Usage: TSP_LK.cpp, and doublylinkedlist.cpp
	*	Genetic algorithm
	*	Currently this is still an int-main implemented file 
	*	the final method should take in a doubly linked list and return the best or a batch of best solutions to the problem
